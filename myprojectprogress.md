I'm still not 100% sure of what project I wanna do overall. I definitely like the idea of something that integrates
with a game or something that I like. There are a plethora of project within that realm though. I considered
a neural net for LoL but for that I would likely need the source and although the executable is free, the source 
code isn't i don't think so that would be very difficult if not impossible in this amount of time. As a result i'm
thinking of maybe a scroll bar/ticker that would tell me game info and updates about things i'm interested in like
overwatch, csgo, LoL or things like that. Now then which ones it pulls may be controlled by like a drop down and 
maybe I would integrateit with FB or Twitter to get info from those pages about the game and announcements they
release that way.
